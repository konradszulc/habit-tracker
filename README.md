# **Konrad's Amazing Habit Tracker**

Welcome to My Habit Tracker Repo, This was a project for my Dynamic Web Applications with JavaScript Course. It includes a handy site to store, motivate, and keep track of habits worth tracking for the last 7 days. You can add or delete a habit, mark days that have been completed, and watch as the counter goes up. All saved to the local browser storage, that can then be made into JSON file if so desired. It can import JSON files to view old kept logs of what habits you did, and if want to save a log, then export a JSON file as well. You do not want any? well Delete it all and reset the whole table/local storage. 

## Key Features

In a simplified way the key features of the site are:

1. Add or Deleting Custom Created Habits to track
2. Tick Days where it was completed 
3. Collects current streak of days
4. Stores locally in browser, does not reset entire table on refresh
5. Can export JSON of the locally saved Data for back up
6. Can import JSON files to view previous
7. Reset all data if so desire
8. Added bonus of motivational quotes on each refresh

## How Can I run it? 

Please Use the following Github Pages link: 
which will work for either Mac or Windows

if preffered to use locally:
1. Save all files to your local computer
2. Open index.html in your preffered browser
3. See console output by opening browser developer tools to verify if errors. Shortcuts for Windows/Linux: Press F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I. Shortcuts for Mac: Press Cmd + Opt + I
4. Enjoy using the site, view demo video for explanation on how it works.

Below includes some screenshots of how the site should look on first render, and after potential habits are added.

## Reflection

Understanding and going through the process of creating this project was very useful to witness and put the various skills learned throughout this course. The ability to use different DOM manipulation, dynamically altering the page in a seamless and smooth transition. Utilizing events to make the page interactive to the users’ inputs, and as well to display various feedback to the user like alerts. Effectively creating visually striking application, with accessibility support such as screen reader or keyboard control, mobile view is essential to be inclusive to everyone in this day and age, especially with technology. The ability to store data locally on the browser, understand how it is stored, to then pull up that data in different functions or to export to JSON is beneficial to future projects. As a unique feature wanting to better show my understanding of how to access different elements on the page, by including a unique motivational quote display, that is random each time the page renders. There is still much more to learn, such as being able to also potentially implement BOM, to create different pages of navigation such as a login to have the tracker be for specific individuals. As well, to potentially add goals for users, that is then tracked real time to reach their goals with a progress bar, like run a total of 25km in a week.

A challenge I faced was the debugging process, as sometimes, code can miss some syntax or variables can be spelt differently in other places of code, thus preventing the code from running properly without easy way to notice. Using console.log was helpful to understand if a variable received the data it was intended to receive, allowing to narrow down the source of the issue. As well, if there was an error consistently having the developer tools open to notice any strange behavior in the site runtime. Furthermore, I would also want to improve styling a bit, to have less inline styles, while I tried to create more important styles in seperate sheet, it was also effective for me to use inline for smaller elements, but for the future, best to have more consistent styles in a styles sheet. Lastly, commenting is very important for future reference or for others viewing work to understand certain pieces of code, while I write lots of comments now is for the benefit of learning to practise getting better at coding, but for future reference such extensive commenting can also be time consuming and wasteful for professional projects. It is important to keep in mind, short and to the point and not as extensive breakdowns of code. Overall, this beginning in depth yet simple project was a great way to put my knowledge of the usefulness of JavaScript to the test and look forward to potential future projects that can utilize this experience!
